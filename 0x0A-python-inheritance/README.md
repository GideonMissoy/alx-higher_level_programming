This directory is to help improve understanding and expound on Inheritance.
- When one class inherits from another, it takes on the attributes and methods of the first class. The original class is called the parent class, and the new class is called the child class.
- The child class can inherit any or all of the attributes and methods of the parent class, but it also is free to define new attributes and methods of its own.
